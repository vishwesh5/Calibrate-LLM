The increased solar radiation would lead to a rapid rise in global temperatures, causing the polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise. This would result in devastating consequences for coastal ecosystems and human populations. On the other hand, if the Earth were 10 feet further from the Sun, the reduced solar radiation would lead to a cooling of the planet, potentially causing glaciers to form and sea levels to drop. However, this would also result in a significant decrease in global temperatures, making the planet inhospitable to many forms of life.", "rejected": "If the Earth were 10 feet closer to the Sun: Increased solar radiation: The reduced distance would lead to a significant increase in solar radiation, resulting in a rise in global temperatures. Loss of atmospheric gases: The increased heat would cause atmospheric gases to escape into space, potentially leading to a loss of atmospheric pressure and a thinner atmosphere. Changes in ocean currents and weather patterns: The altered solar radiation would disrupt global ocean currents and weather patterns, potentially leading to extreme climate fluctuations. Impacts on plant life: The increased temperatures and altered radiation would likely cause widespread extinction among plant species that are adapted to the current climate.
